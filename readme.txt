Basically front end developers struggle to understand the behavior of how double equals works in JavaScript. It actually works based on Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm. So this application will help the developers to understand how an expression with double equals works based on AECA. It will display the step by step evaluation process of the expression that uses double equals. It will help the users to understand the recursive process of how evaluation happens.

And this is my first project on github by using git. If anyone notices that I am doing wrong with git/github please poke me by using laraprabhu@gmail.com
